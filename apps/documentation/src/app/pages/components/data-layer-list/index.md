## Overview

A list of all data layers that have been added to the chart. The layers can be re-ordered by dragging, and toggled on/off by clicking the checkboxes. Expanding a layer's accordion panel reveals a list of datasets and annotations included in that layer, and allows you to change some basic dataset options.

## Example

{{ NgDocActions.demo("DataLayerListDemoComponent", { expanded: true, defaultTab: "HTML" }) }}
